* Spring Android Showcase
**********************************

Introduction
------------
This project requires set up of the Android SDK, command line tools, Maven, the Maven Android Plugin, and Android Maven artifacts such as Spring dependencies. This document walks step by step throught that setup.

Development Environment
-----------------------
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
The Android SDK is required for developing Android applications. Google provides command line tools, and an Eclipse plugin for building Android applications, however you are not restricted to only those options.
The Maven Android Plugin makes use of the Android SDK command line tools to compile and deploy the app to the emulator, so there is no need for a separate IDE setup or configuration.

Add Android to your Path
Example: a .bash_profile on a Mac:
$ export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk-mac_x86
$ export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

Install Android SDK 1.5
-----------------------
You need to install the Android 1.5 SDK (Level 3) for the sample application to run. Our goal with Spring Android is to provide backward compatibility with older versions of Android. To illustrate this compatibility, the sample application runs on Android 1.5.
Open the Android SDK and AVD Manager window:
$ android
Select Available packages from the left hand column
Select the checkbox for Android Repository in the main window
Select SDK Platform Android 1.5, API 3, revision 4
Click the Install Selected button to complete the download and installation.
Note: you may want to simply install all the available updates, but be aware it might take longer on a slower Internet connection

Configure an Android Virtual Device
-----------------------------------
http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/avd.html
Open the Android SDK and AVD Manager window:
$ android
Select Virtual devices in the left hand column and click the New button
Enter 3 in the Name field
Select Android 1.5 API Level 3 in the Target selector
Click Create AVD to finish
Note: The sample application is configured to look for an AVD with the name "3". Otherwise, you can name the AVD whatever you like. 
Using "3" for the name simply is a visual indicator of which API level it uses.

Build and Run the Server app
----------------------------
$ cd /spring-android-showcase/server
$ mvn clean install
Deploy the .war to a Servlet 2.5 or > ServletContainer, such as Tomcat 6.
Start the server

Configure the Android Client
----------------------------
Open /spring-android-showcase/client/res/values/strings.xml
Note: base_uri uses host 10.0.2.2. Do not use localhost as that refers to the Android emulator itself. 10.0.2.2 redirects to your computer.

Build and Run the Android Client
--------------------------------
$ cd /spring-android-showcase/client
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn android:emulator-start
Ensure the emulator is fully initialized and ready or the deploy will fail.
$ mvn android:deploy
View Logging
$ adb logcat
